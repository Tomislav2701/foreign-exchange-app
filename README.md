## ‚ö° Makefile Commands

The project includes a Makefile for convenience. If you have `make` installed (or use Git Bash/WSL on Windows), use these commands in the project root.

### 1. Build the Project

- With Maven

```bash
make build
```
This runs mvnw.cmd clean package on Windows to build the project and produce the JAR file in the target directory.
   
```bash
make run
```
This runs mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run on Windows

- With Docker

```bash
make docker-build
```

This executes:
docker build -t fexapp .
and packages your app into a Docker image named fexapp.

```bash
make docker-run
```

This runs the container (naming it fexapp_container) and maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host.

```bash
make docker-stop
```
Stops and removes the fexapp_container if it‚Äôs running.
